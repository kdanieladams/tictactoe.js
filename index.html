        <h1>Tic Tac Toe JS</h1>
        <p>This is Tic Tac Toe (or Noughts and Crosses, depending on where you're from) 
            written in ES5, with a MiniMax AI.  MiniMax will always select the best move 
            possible, meaning the best you could hope for is a tie.</p>
        <p>To make the game fun, I've added an element of randomness such that 1/5 times, 
            the AI chooses a random square instead of what MiniMax suggests. This is often
            a bad move, and so is your opening to take the win.  Miss it, and you're likely
            to tie or lose.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You're X's, X's go first, and 3 across in any direction wins.</li>
            <li>AI is based on MiniMax.</li>
            <li>1/5 chance the AI will choose a random square instead of MiniMax.</li>
        </ul>
