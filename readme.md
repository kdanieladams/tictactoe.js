# Tic Tac Toe JS
### by K. Daniel Adams

This is Tic Tac Toe (or Noughts and Crosses, depending on where you're from) written in ES5, with a MiniMax AI.  MiniMax will always select the best move possible, meaning the best you could hope for is a tie.

To make the game fun, I've added an element of randomness such that 1/5 times, the AI chooses a random square instead of what MiniMax suggests. This is often a bad move, and so is your opening to take the win.  Miss it, and you're likely to tie or lose.

## Usage
1. Clone the repo 
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:kdanieladams/tictactoe.js.git
    ```
2. Run the `index.html` file in a browser.
    ```
    cd ./tictactoe.js/
    open index.html
    ```
